I created a COVID dashboard that tracks only places where my family lives. [Check it out.](/kovid-dashboard.html) And [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uh-Doo1FIiblICD1DZjBe7NDujMM1CLS/view?usp=sharing). The dashboard is updated by a script that runs in a crontab on a RaspberryPi -- set up with help of [this tool](https://github.com/riklopfer/find-sshable). The script which creates the dashboard can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/riklopfer/covid-plots).
