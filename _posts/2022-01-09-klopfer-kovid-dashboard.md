I created a COVID dashboard that tracks only places where my family lives. [Check it out.](/kovid-dashboard.html). The dashboard is updated by a script that runs in a crontab on a RaspberryPi -- set up with help of [this tool](https://github.com/riklopfer/find-sshable). The script which creates the dashboard can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/riklopfer/covid-plots).
