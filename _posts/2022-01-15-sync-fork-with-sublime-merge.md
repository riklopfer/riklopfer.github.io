I have forgotten how to do this enough times that I created a screencast showing how to do it. Also wrote down the steps below. 

[![Sync Github Fork Sublime Merge](https://img.youtube.com/vi/yRrIkCdClPE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRrIkCdClPE "Sync Github Fork Sublime Merge")

1. Checkout target branch locally (let's assume our target is "master")
2. Expand "Remotes" (in Locations sidebar)
3. Right-click "upstream"
4. Fetch from upstream
5. `<enter>` or click fetch
6. Expand "upstream"
7. Right-click "master"
8. "Merge upstream/master into master..."
9. Complete merge
10. Push to origin
